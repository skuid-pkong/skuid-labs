# Standalone.js
This inline snippet uses hardcoded values for model name and interval length. It will require modification on a per-use basis. This does require the snippet to be called from the Action Framework, from a Page Rendered or other event.

# Expects Params.js
This inline snippet is designed to take advantage of Reusable Action Sequences with Inputs.  The 2 named inputs this snippet expects are "Model" (value or model type) and "Timeout" (value type).
